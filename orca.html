                <h4>The Brief</h4>
                <h2>Transforming the Seattle Commute</h2>
                <p>Orca wants to reduce the amount of cars on the roads and become more environmentally friendly by providing better experience for people using public transit for their daily commute. Currently, the Orca Card site is the only online access point away from the kiosks and retail locations, which is not mobile friendly. The site also does not have the structure to support easy access to information or card management.</p>
                <h3>Aspects to Consider</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>What are some of the unmet needs & pain points of current Orca Card users?</p></li>
                    <li><p>What unmet needs do users have which might be met by a mobile application?</p></li>
                    <li><p>What are the most important & relevant informations for daily commuters?</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Scope</h4>
                <h2>Big Idea, Short Time</h2>
                <img class="img-responsive two-weeks" src="img/two_weeks.svg" alt="">
                <p>This project was <b>two week long sprint</b>. Within this short period we have done intensive <b>user research</b> to uncover the most comon needs/pain points of current Orca card users.The reesults of our user interviews clearly validated out <b>initial hypothesis</b>.<br>To avoid any communication problems and to insure that we can work in a pleasent and productiv environmet we spend and entire day on building proper <b>team charter</b>, clear timeline and working environment/stylesheet. I have been appointed to be a <b>team leader</b> responsible for <b>conflict resolution</b> and any problem that would arise.</p>

                <h4>Discovery Stage</h4>
                <h2>Year 2020</h2>
                <p>The first thing on our list was to understand the limitation of the current system. Through our <b>market research</b> we found out everything about the current technology and the contract between King County and Vix Technology (ORCA). We also find out about new contract that is already in place and will be implemented in 2019.
                Based on the data promising bright future and after breaf <b>consultation with developers</b> we have decided to focus on the vision we had for our application rather than limiting our design to fit current limitation like lack of protocol for <b>Apple Pay</b>.</p>

                <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                <h2>What Linda Told Us</h2>
                <p>Our <b>primary persona</b> Linda Bee is a result of 15 <b>user interviews</b> that we have conducted in first two days of our project. Linda told us a lot of important informations like quote: <strong><em>"I never know how much money I've left on my Orca card"</em></strong>. But what really surprised us was how unsafe she feels. She says:</p><p class="col-sm-6" id="quote">"I allways carry a pepper spray with me."</p><p>We have revieled that 9 out of 10 women is affraid of being followed by a stranger; 7 out of 10 carries pepper spray; and 3 out of 10 were previously sexually assaulted.</p>
                <p>This imposed <b>unexpected challeng</b>. We knew we had only 10 days left before our <b>pitch</b> and this was not something we wanted to leave out!</p>
